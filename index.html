      <h1>Welcome to Our Baby's Gift Registry!</h1>
      <p>
        We are excited to welcome our new family member. Only two months to go!
        We can't wait to introduce you to our son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of you have asked about getting gifts for the baby, so we have
        created a registry to help you choose something that we need. There is
        no obligation or expectation to buy anything. We are grateful for your
        love and support, and we can't wait to celebrate with you soon! (Also
        please come to babysit! ðŸ˜„)
      </p>
